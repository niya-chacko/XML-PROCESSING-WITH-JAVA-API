Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and readable. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in services. Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages, while programmers have developed many application programming interfaces (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data. The XML DOM (Document Object Model) defines the properties and methods for accessing and editing XML.However, before an XML document can be accessed, it must be loaded into an XML DOM object. All modern browsers have a built-in XML parser that can convert text into an XML DOM object.
